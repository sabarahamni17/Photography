**A 3-Second Moment Photography**

![Intro image](images/intro/intro.png)

<p align='justify'>Hey there, I'm Reza. I work with photography as an act of three-second attention, drawn to fleeting moments of transition—shifting light, moving bodies, spaces suspended between use and meaning. My practice lives in the tension between observation and interpretation, inviting the viewer to slow down and notice what usually slips past. Step into my world and linger, where three-second moments unfold into visual stories—intimate, deliberate, and quietly alive through the lens.</p>
